1. The linear search would take 7 iterations to find G
2. The binary search would take 3 iterations to find G
3. fib(10) = 55
   fib(11) = 89
   fib(12) = 144
   
1. if given an unsorted collection I would use a linear search. a binary search would only be able to find the 
sought after item by chance and may skip over the desired item in its search. I think I would use an iterative search
because in general iteration requires fewer proocesses than iteration to complete.

2. if given a sorted collection I would use binary search. Binary search will require fewer checks than a linear search and 
therefore is faster. I would use an iteration for the same reason as stated above.
