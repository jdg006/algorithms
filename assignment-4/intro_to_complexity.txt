1. An algorithm that has O(1) is a Formula 1 race car and an algorithm that has O(2n) is a square wheeled tricycle.
2. The best case scenario for a binary search is 1 check to find the specified value.
3. The worst case scenario for binary search would be the amount of times that you can evenly divide the amount of numbers
   in the array by 2 + 1
4. The bound case scenarion is roughly mid-way between the worst case scenario and the best case scenario, but runs closer to
   the worst case scenario.
